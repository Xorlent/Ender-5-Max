## Ender-5 Max Print Head Cable Holddown
### Background
Did you buy an Ender-5 Max enclosure only to find the print head cable drags badly on the roof of the enclosure?  Here is the fix.
### Materials Needed
1. Two M3 x 12mm screws
   - These will replace the side screws currently holding down your print head control cable
2. Two 4x15mm taper shoulder wood screws
   - These will secure the cap to the holddown base
3. A print of the two .STEP files found in this folder
   - Do not use PLA
   - The cap should be printed upside down for best results
   - .2mm layer height, 4 wall loops minimum (5 recommended), 5 top and 5 bottom layers, 15% infill
### Installation
1. Remove the enclosure lid and move the print head so it is accessible.
2. Unscrew the two side M3 screws at the base of the control cable where it enters the print head.
   - Do not remove the center M3 screw, this will remain in place.
3. Install the printed base using two 12mm long M3 screws.
4. Capture the print head cable with the printed cap and secure the cap with two 4x15mm wood screws.
   - Install screws in 2 revolution increments, backing out 3 turns each time to prevent fracturing your printed part.
6. Reinstall the enclosure lid.
7. Re-run input shaping calibration since we have added some mass to the print head.
