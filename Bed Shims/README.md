## Ender-5 Max Bed Plate Leveling Shims
### Background
The Ender-5 Max build plate is quite thin for its size which results in significant warping.  To give your bed mesh leveling the best chance of success, add shims to move the four corners of the bed roughly level with each other.
### Evaluating Your Bed Mesh
1. In Orca Slicer, connect to your printer and click the "Device" tab
2. Scroll down and within the right info column you will see a 3D graph of the measured mesh.  Assess which corners of the bed need shims to bring them near level with the highest corner and print the required shims.
3. Unplug machine and insert shims.
4. In the Orca Slicer "Device" tab, clear the current bed mesh data.
5. Power the machine on and perform all calibration routines.
6. Once calibration is complete, in the Orca Slicer "Device" tab, evaluate the current bed mesh data to see if you got the desired result.
### Shim Printing Instructions
